This example SAS code subsets your data based on values of a variable by specifying the score code to create a filter variable (filter_flag) that is 0 for the observations that you want to keep, and 1 for those to be filtered out. Then the metadata is modified to assign the role of FILTER to this filter variable.

**Instructions:** In Model Studio, add a SAS Code node to your pipeline.  Now, open it and paste the Training Code into the Training Code pane and the Scoring Code into the Scoring Code pane, and modify both for your subsetting needs (change the variable and values used).  Finally, save and close the node.  Nodes added to this SAS Code node will use this filter to subset your data in the pipeline branch.
