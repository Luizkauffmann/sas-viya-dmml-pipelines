This example SAS code reverses the filter from the Anomaly Detection node so that the outliers are kept and non-outliers excluded. Score code is used that reverses this filter, then the metadata is modified to use this new variable as the FILTER variable.  

**Instructions:** In Model Studio, after an Anomaly Detection node where the "Anomaly indicator role" has been set to "Input", add a SAS Code node to your pipeline, open it and paste the Training Code into the Training Code pane and the Scoring Code into the Scoring Code pane, then save and close the node.  Nodes added to this SAS Code node will use the reversed filter; that is, they will train on the outliers identified by the Anomaly Detection node.
